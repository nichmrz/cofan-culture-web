            <h2>Language Challenges</h2>
            <p>The A'ingae language has been having some really big problemms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spanish is like taking over cause its everywhere</li>
                <li>Less and less people have speaked A'ingae</li>
                <li>They need more better books and stuff in there language</li>
                <li>Its hard to say new things about computers and phones in A'ingae</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Preservation and Revitalization</h2>
            <p>They're doing lots of cool stuff to save there language and culture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They have teached A'ingae to more people then ever before</li>
                <li>They're gonna write down all the stories and words before they disappear</li>
                <li>If they make more learning materials, kids could learn better</li>
                <li>They want everyone to speak A'ingae everyday</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Unless they keep there language alive, they might loose there whole cultural identity and connection to there ancestors. That would be like super sad!</p>
